# Quality Improvement Magic Eightball for Chapel Hill Internal Medicine

This is an incredibly simple "shiny app" that expects a "My Department with Diabetes" report summary from EPIC as input. It then takes that report and "forecasts" patients that will be overdue for their annual A1c, foot exam, and eye exam in the next 30-120 days (user specified). The goal of the program is to catch patients and bring them into clinic before they are overdue, thereby expedieting care!

## Future Issues
When this simple app breaks because of differences in the EPIC reporting system/exports (under the assumption that they will not guarantee backwards compatibility), please reach out to Nick. You can find his email in the UNC-Med directory. 

## Important Note 
*Never "publish"" this app or run this data on anything but your local server in order to protect patient information*.
